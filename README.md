 What is it? 
 A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

Why should I make it?
An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp
